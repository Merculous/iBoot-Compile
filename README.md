# iBoot-Compile - By Merculous ([@Vyce_Merculous](https://twitter.com/Vyce_Merculous))

## Prerequisites

Python 3

You <b>MUST</b> install HomeDiagnostic.pkg, peferably build 13F40 since this will give us 21 32-bit devices to compile for (A5-A6).
If you have any issues while installing HomeDiagnostic, you may have SIP enabled. Enter Internet Recovery, open a shell and disable SIP (csrutil disable), and done.

## Usage:

#### Place 'Odder.py' in your folder containing the leaked iBoot files (Source this yourself), cd into that folder and then run './Odder.py --build' (which is the main arg) or './Odder.py' to see usage.
